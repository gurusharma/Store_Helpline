Abstract
The world has moved to automated solutions for everything from production to Point of Sale. It is now a great time that we launch our idea to established supermarkets around us. Our project will be more than just a kiosk at your local superstore and will contain differentiating features like syncing the cart to your phone and requesting for help from a store associate. This project will eliminate the need of having extra employees in the store even when there is no need for them. Furthermore, feedback by the customers will make the store customer oriented in many aspects.

1. Introduction
We all have been in a situation where we go to a superstore and try to look for a product and its not available or we want to ask for some assistance but looking for an associate is an altogether different task. 
We thought to do something about it. We have designed a kiosk with an interactive touch display  a signal light.
Our project will store details of all the products and the help associates in the store. As a customer, you can search for any products in the store and create a shopping list which can then be accessed by a companion android app. As a customer, you will also have an option to call for an associate and as you do that, the signal light will turn on until the associate has helped you, he/she will then turn it off using there RF-ID fob.
